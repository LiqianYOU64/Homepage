        <img src="image/me.jpg">
        <P>As a master student majoring in interaction design at UQ with 2-year working experience in UI and UX, I
            strive to continually develop my skill sets to achieve long-term goal of a career in digital technology by
            using strong design and web development skills.</P>
        <p>“I believe in the power of elegant minimalism in a world increasingly saturated with garish colour.”
            Over the last five years, I have specialised in graphic and website where I shift a variety of
            digital information into a more interesting, acceptable, usable and readable visualisation. Design
            is about people and for people. That's why I love travelling and want to immerse myself into
            different cultures, languages, and experiences to improve my design skills on people based.

                <h4>Design Exploration</h4>
                <p>My individual design exploration is related to the memorial tour. In spite of the two world wars,
                    there have been countless wars in the world. Many people fought for their families and countries,
                    but few have been remembered by young generations. So, I want to build a website which allows users
                    to find and select memorial tours in QLD.</p>
                <p>After conducting the world cafe method on week 6, I found that there are fewer data and information
                    websites on animal protection, while there are many valuable animal datasets on SLQ. Our team named
                    animal protector was set up in week 6 and we focused on developing three main functions: news, game,
                    information and education.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pro">
                <h4>Main Project</h4>
                <p>This website collects data from the wildlife of QLD API with the functions of recent news related to
                    wild animal protection, the game of learning animal protection knowledge, the animal hospitals
                    searching, and emergency chatroom. It aims at raising the awareness of how important to protect the
                    endangered wild animals. Besides, viewers have a chance to learn basic information about endangered
                    wild animals in QLD, including their inhabitants, description, distribution and potential threats.
                    And there is a game called super animal that helps viewers to learn more about extinction animals.
                </p>
                <p>As a designer in our team, I am responsible for the design and multimedia work in the whole project,
                    for instance: sketch, storyboard, scenario, paper prototype, HIFI prototype, video shooting and
                    editing, website visualization, game interface, etc. These will be presented in the following
                    sections.</p>

                <h4>Part A: Proposal</h4>
                <p>This section focused on investigation of the intended audience and domain research. The concept tools
                    and design methods I learned from DECO 7110 are Use-Case Scenario, Mind-mapping, which I applied in
                    the Part A. As our target
                    audience are government officers, students, QLD visitors, citizens or any animal lovers, from
                    teenagers to adults, I used storyboards and scenarios to probe user experience and behaviours. I was
                    the individual designer of creating LO-FI
                    and HI-FI prototype, storyboards, scenarios and two types of website visualisation.</p>

                    tough work to insist on writing every week but it is helpful to remind me of what I have done for
                    three months. I followed the course schedule and successfully built
                    a website with comprehensive functions with my team members. Besides, contributing to the tutor and
                    lecture’s advice and suggestions, our team achieved the goals during the previous proposal and
                    presentation in the workshop and
                    practice. </p>

                <h4>Portfolio</h4>
                <p>In the portfolio, I firstly wrote down the text in the document and arranged the image and files I
                    created in the whole semester. Then, I used the Adobe XD to create HI-FI prototype following the
                    reference of DECO1800 sample in 2018. Finally,
                    I generated the materials into the HTML, formulated the style in CSS and add interactions in
                    JavaScript.</p>

                            my home town—Shanghai, China. I used as the dark blue and black background with the contrast
                            of white words to leave a deep impression
                            on my audience.</p>

                            put two personal pictures about travelling and volunteer work to allow employers to remember

                <h5>Course Reflection</h5>
                <p>It was a memorable time in learning DECO7180 Design Computing Studio 1 - Interactive Technology this
                    semester, which is a new journey in my master study. In terms of the courses, some of the workshops
                    are really helpful, especially PHP tutorial, which is new to me. However, the activities in contact
                    are not particularly useful. We only discussed the class but hard to make a conclusion or learn
                    something. In the aspect of JavaScript and jQuery, it is more efficient to learn online video rather
                    than having class because the contents on the workshop are very fundamental, but still a good way to
                    get suggestions from the tutor.
                </p>
                <p class="i"><i>“Based on what I know of this course, I expect to be doing some website or application
                        design, front end, back end and software development this semester.”
                    </i></p>
                <p>This is recorded in my first journal. During the 13 weeks, I have learned PHP, JavaScript and other
                    design skills, methods and experience the whole process of design computing. In the beginning, I was
                    worried about team cooperation and too much coding. But now, I make four friends with different
                    skills and background, learning a lot from them and most importantly, I know how to cooperate with
                    others to achieve the same goal. Doing more design and coding work-related the whole project, I have
                    the chance to experience the project process which may help my future career.</p>

                    select one of the interesting group to find an activity to attend.</p>
                <p>During the design process, our team conducted a series background research, including brainstroming,

                    data helped us construct this human-based social mobile app.</p>

            <p>MoodBall is the team project of the UQ interaction design program. It is a magic ball that allows
                users to detect and share feelings through music, lights and visualizations. We want to create immersive
                music modulating experience for joy and relaxation as well as to provide mental support through sharing and
                engaging with remote users.</p>

                <h3>Catch Cash</h3>
                <p>It is a somatosensory game called <b><i>Catch Cash</i></b>. Inspired by the game Daddy Pig In
                    Avalanche, I created a character named Yuri. The player stands in front of the camera and move the
                    body to control Yuri. When catching the colourful diamonds, the user will get related scores. The
                    game will be terminated when catching black diamonds and the Arduino gift box will open
                    automatically. Players can get chocolates or candies as rewards.</p>

                <p><b><i>FoodCare</i></b> is my research project during the last year of master study. It is a smarthome
                    based food detection system support specific dietary for those with medical conditions. There are
                    three modes with different food detection datasets and various interactions including pregnancy,
                    vegetarian and seniors. Users can select one mode, login Costco account and upload the online
                    shopping list. When Parcel delivery, the food detection system is working. AI camera on the crisper
                    can detect food categories and monitor expired date and give voice feedback to the users.</p>
